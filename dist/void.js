//like in java void is a type that represents the absence of value.
var doSomething = function () {
    console.log("Hello World");
};
//any is a type that represents all types like Object in java.
var foo1 = "Hello World";
//never is a type that represents the absence of value.
var throwError = function () {
    throw new Error("Error");
};
//unknown is a type that represents the absence of value.
var foo2 = "Hello World";
//can not assign a value to unknown type.
//foo2 = 10;
//but can you can do this
var s2 = foo2;
var pageNumber1 = "10";
//type casting is used to convert the type of variable.
var pageNumber2 = pageNumber1;
